# Spaceship-Commander
A turn-based spaceship battle simulator game. **Most of this project was written in 2013/2014 before I used source control**. It's an example of my programming beginnings.

Though the game is by no means feature-complete (there was a lot more I wanted to add), I eventually came to realize that Java Swing was not the best UI for something like this.

As of now, **this project is generally abandoned, but I'm leaving it here as a matter of record**, and because I am still proud of it all things considered.
